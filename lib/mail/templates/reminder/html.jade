      h4 Hello #[+fullNames(thisWeek.names)]!
      | It is everyone’s responsibility to keep the kitchen neat and tidy but as kitchen heroes you guys have a tiny bit extra responsibility this week. Please do your best to:

  tr
    td(colspan="2").content-block
      ol
        li Keep an eye on the dishwashers. Start them when full, empty when finished.
        li Wipe down the counters and tables (preferably right after breakfast & lunch).
        li Remove old and smelly stuff from the fridges and the freezer.

  tr
    td(colspan="2").content-block
      | Have you noticed the kitchen-hero-praiser iPad in the kitchen? Here are some tips for increasing your #[+feedbackTypes(feedbackTypes)] probability during the week:

  tr
    td(colspan="2").content-block

      - var arr = [];
      - arr.push("Ensure that all the seed, nut and 🍏🍌🍊 bowls are filled up.");
      - arr.push("Dark and gloomy? Light some candles! Make the kitchen cozy.");
      - arr.push("Put on some 🎵 to set the mood. Something you like. Not Nickelback...");
      - arr.push("Get some 🌹 for the office. Why? They smell good and are pretty.");
      - arr.push("Tell Björn to place a food order for something special. Be creative!");
      - arr.push("Treat your co-workers to a luxury breakfast or fika by baking something.");
      - arr.push("Empty the trash cans if they start to smell like 💩");

      ul
        li #[+sample(arr)]
        li #[+sample(arr)]

  - var resultsPrevWeek = prevWeek.feedback[0].total + prevWeek.feedback[1].total;
  if resultsPrevWeek
    tr
      td(colspan="2").content-block
        | Last weeks kitchen heroes was #[+fullNames(prevWeek.names)], they got:

    +results(images, prevWeek.feedback)

    tr
      td(colspan="2").content-block
        | They therefore received a score of #[+score(prevWeek.feedback)]. Think you can beat that?
